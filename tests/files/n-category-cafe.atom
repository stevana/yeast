<p>I see Steve Awodey has a paper just out <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11229-015-0781-6">Carnap and the invariance of logical truth</a>. We briefy discussed this idea in the context of Mautner&#8217;s 1946 article back <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2012/01/logic_as_invarianttheory.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Steve ends the article by portraying homotopy type theory as following in the same tradition, but now where invariance is under homotopy equivalence. I wonder if we&#8217;ll see some variant of the model/theory duality he and Forssell <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/03/firstorder_logical_duality.html">found</a> in the case of HoTT.</p>

<p>Suppose you have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigroup">semigroup</a>: that is, a set with an associative product.  Also suppose that </p>

<p><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='block'><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mi>y</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> x y x = x  </annotation></semantics></math></p>

<p>for all <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>x</annotation></semantics></math> and all <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>y</annotation></semantics></math>.  </p>

<p><strong>Puzzle 1.</strong>  Prove that </p>

<p><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='block'><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mi>y</mi><mi>z</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>x</mi><mi>z</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> x y z = x z </annotation></semantics></math></p>

<p>The proofs I know are not &#8216;deep&#8217;: they involve nothing more than simple equation-pushing.  But the results were surprising to me, because they feel like you&#8217;re getting something for nothing. </p>

But in a monoid, the law <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mi>y</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>x y x = x</annotation></semantics></math> is deadly, since you can take <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>x = 1</annotation></semantics></math> and conclude that <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>y</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>y = 1</annotation></semantics></math> for all <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>y</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p><i>guest post by <b><a href = "https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~msta039/">Mike Stay</a></b></i></p>

<p>Greg Meredith and I have a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04311">short paper</a> that&#8217;s been accepted for <a href="http://hdra15.gforge.inria.fr/">Higher-Dimensional Rewriting and Applications
(HDRA) 2015</a> on modeling the asynchronous polyadic pi calculus with 2-categories.  We avoid domain theory entirely and model the operational semantics directly; full abstraction is almost trivial.  As a nice side-effect, we get a new tool for reasoning about consumption of resources during a computation.  </p>

<p>It&#8217;s a small piece of a much larger project, which I&#8217;d like to describe here in a series of posts.  This post will talk about lambda calculus for a few reasons.  First, lambda calculus is simpler, but complex enough to illustrate one of our fundamental insights.  Lambda calculus is to serial computation what pi calculus is to concurrent computation; lambda calculus talks about a single machine doing a computation, while pi calculus talks about a network of machines communicating over a network with potentially random delays.  There is at most one possible outcome for a computation in the lambda calculus, while there are many possible outcomes in a computation in the pi calculus.  Both the lazy lambda calculus and the pi calculus, however, have as an integral part of their semantics the notion of <i>waiting</i> for a sub-computation to complete before moving onto another one.  Second, the denotational semantics of lambda calculus in Set is well understood, as is its generalization to cartesian closed categories; this semantics is far simpler than the denotational semantics of pi calculus and serves as a good introduction.  The operational semantics of lambda calculus is also simpler than that of pi calculus and there is previous work  on modeling it using higher categories.</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>Alonzo Church invented the lambda calculus as part of his attack on Hilbert&#8217;s third problem, also known as the <i>Entscheidungsproblem</i>, which asked for an algorithm to solve any mathematical problem.  Church published his proof that no such algorithm exists in 1936.  Turing invented his eponymous machines, also to solve the <i>Entscheidungsproblem</i>, and published his independent proof a few months after Church.  When he discovered that Church had beaten him to it, Turing proved in 1937 that the two approaches were equivalent in power.  Since Turing machines were much more &#8220;mechanical&#8221; than the lambda calculus, the development of computing machines relied far more on Turing&#8217;s approach, and it was only decades later that people started writing compilers for more friendly programming languages.  I&#8217;ve heard it quipped that &#8220;the history of programming languages is the piecemeal rediscovery of the lambda calculus by computer scientists.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lambda calculus consists of a set of &#8220;terms&#8221; together with some relations on the terms that tell how to &#8220;run the program&#8221;.  Terms are built up out of &#8220;term constructors&#8221;; in the lambda calculus there are three: one for variables, one for defining functions (Church denoted this operation with the Greek letter lambda, hence the name of the calculus), and one for applying those functions to inputs.  I&#8217;ll talk about these constructors and the relations more below.</p>

<p>Church introduced the notion of &#8220;types&#8221; to avoid programs that never stop.  Modern programming languages also use types to avoid programmer mistakes and encode properties about the program, like proving that secret data is inaccessible outside certain parts of the program.  The &#8220;simply-typed&#8221; lambda calculus starts with a set of base types and takes the closure under the binary operation <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mo>&#x02192;</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\to</annotation></semantics></math> to get a set of types.  Each term is assigned a type; from this one can deduce the types of the variables used in the term.  An assignment of types to variables is called a <i>typing context</i>.</p>

<p>The search for a semantics for variants of the lambda calculus has typically been concerned with finding sets or &#8220;domains&#8221; such that the interpretation of each lambda term is a function between domains.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_domain">Scott</a> worked out a domain <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>D</annotation></semantics></math> such that the <a href="http://math.andrej.com/2006/03/27/sometimes-all-functions-are-continuous/">continuous functions</a> from <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>D</annotation></semantics></math> to itself are precisely the computable ones.  <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/mathematics/logic-categories-and-sets/introduction-higher-order-categorical-logic">Lambek and Scott</a> generalized the category where we look for semantics from Set to arbitrary cartesian closed categories (CCCs).</p>

<p>Lambek and Scott constructed a <abbr title="CarbonCopyCloner">CCC</abbr> out of lambda terms; we call this category the <i>syntactical category</i>.  Then a structure-preserving functor from the syntactical category to Set or some other <abbr>CCC</abbr> would provide the semantics.  The syntactical category has types as objects and equivalence classes of certain terms as morphisms.  A morphism in the syntactical category goes from a typing context to the type of the term.</p>

<p>John Baez has a set of <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/QG.html">lecture notes</a> from <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-fall2006/">Fall 2006</a> <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-winter2007/">through</a> <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-spring2007/">Spring 2007</a> describing Lambek and Scott&#8217;s approach to the category theory of lambda calculus and generalizing it from cartesian closed categories to symmetric monoidal closed categories so it can apply to quantum computation as well: rather than taking a functor from the syntactical category into Set, we can take a functor into Hilb instead.  He and I also have a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0340">&#8220;Rosetta stone&#8221; paper</a> summarizing the ideas and connecting them with the corresponding generalization of the Curry-Howard isomorphism.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry-Howard_isomorphism">Curry-Howard isomorphism</a> says that types are to propositions as programs are to proofs.  In practice, types are used in two different ways: one as propositions about <i>data</i> and the other as propositions about <i>code</i>.  Programming languages like C, Java, Haskell, and even dynamically typed languages like JavaScript and Python use types to talk about propositions that data satisfies: is it a date or a name?  In these languages, equivalence classes of programs constitute constructive proofs.  Concurrent calculi are far more concerned about propositions that the code satisfies: can it reach a deadlocked state?  In these languages, it is the rewrite rules taking one term to another that behave like proofs.  Melli&#x000E8;s and Zeilberger&#8217;s excellent paper &#8220;<a href="http://noamz.org/papers/funts.pdf">Functors are Type Refinement Systems</a>&#8221; relates these two approaches to typing to each other.</p>

<p>Note that Lambek and Scott&#8217;s approach does not have the sets of terms or variables as objects!  The algebra that defines the set of terms plays only a minor role in the category; there&#8217;s no morphism in the <abbr>CCC</abbr>, for instance, that takes a term <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>t</annotation></semantics></math> and a variable <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>x</annotation></semantics></math> to produce the term <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x003BB;</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>.</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\lambda x.t</annotation></semantics></math>.  This failure to capture the structure of the term in the morphism wasn&#8217;t a big deal for lambda calculus because of &#8220;confluence&#8221; (see below), but it turns out to matter a lot more in calculi like <a href="http://www.lfcs.inf.ed.ac.uk/reports/91/ECS-LFCS-91-180/">Milner&#8217;s pi calculus</a> that describe communicating over a network, where messages can be delayed and arrival times matter for the end result (consider, for instance, two people trying to buy online the last ticket to a concert).</p>

<p>The last few decades have seen domains becoming more and more complicated in order to try to &#8220;unerase&#8221; the information about the structure of terms that gets lost in the domain theory approach and recover the operational semantics.  <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890540102929688">Fiore, Moggi, and Sangiorgi</a>, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.62.4498&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Stark</a> and <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/stark/prempc.html">Cattani, Stark, and Winskel</a> all present domain models of the pi calculus that recursively involve the power set in order to talk about all the possible futures for a term.  Industry has never cared much about denotational semantics: the Java Virtual Machine is an operational semantics for the Java language.</p>

<h3>What we did</h3>

<p>Greg Meredith and I set out to model the operational semantics of the pi calculus directly in a higher category rather than using domain theory.  An obvious first question is, &#8220;What about types?&#8221;  I was particularly worried about how to relate this approach to the kind of thing Scott and Lambek did.  Though it didn&#8217;t make it into the HDRA paper and the details won&#8217;t make it into this post, we found that we&#8217;re able to use the &#8220;type-refinement-as-a-functor&#8221; idea of Melli&#x000E9;s and Zeilberger to show how the algebraic term-constructor functions relate to the morphisms in the syntactical category.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re hoping that this categorical approach to modeling process calculi will help with reasoning about practical situations where we want to compose calculi; for instance, we&#8217;d like to put a hundred pi calculus engines around the edges of a chip and some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_calculus">ambient calculus</a> engines, which have nice features for managing the location of data, in the middle to distribute work among them.</p>

<h3>Lambda calculus</h3>

<p>The lambda calculus consists of a set of &#8220;terms&#8221; together with some relations on the terms.  The set <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>T</annotation></semantics></math> of terms is defined recursively, parametric in a countably infinite set <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>V</annotation></semantics></math> of variables.  The base terms are the variables: if <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>x</annotation></semantics></math> is an element of <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>V</annotation></semantics></math>, then <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>x</annotation></semantics></math> is a term in <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>T</annotation></semantics></math>.  Next, given any two terms <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>&#x02032;</mo><mo>&#x02208;</mo><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>t, t&apos; \in T</annotation></semantics></math>, we can apply one to the other to get <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>&#x02032;</mo><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>t(t&apos;)</annotation></semantics></math>.  We say that <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>t</annotation></semantics></math> is in the <i>head position</i> of the application  and <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>&#x02032;</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>t&apos;</annotation></semantics></math> in the <i>tail position</i>.  (When the associativity of application is unclear, we&#8217;ll also use parentheses around subterms.)  Finally, we can abstract out a variable from a term: given a variable <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>x</annotation></semantics></math> and a term <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>t,</annotation></semantics></math> we get a term <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x003BB;</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>.</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\lambda x.t</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

<p>Church described three relations on terms.  The first relation, alpha, relates any two lambda abstractions that differ only in the variable name.  This is exactly the same as when we consider the function <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>x</mi> <mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>f(x) = x^2</annotation></semantics></math> to be identical to the function <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>y</mi> <mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>f(y) = y^2</annotation></semantics></math>.  The third relation, eta, says that there&#8217;s no difference between a function <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>f</annotation></semantics></math> and a &#8220;middle-man&#8221; function that gets an input <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>x</annotation></semantics></math> and applies the function <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>f</annotation></semantics></math> to it: <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x003BB;</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>.</mo><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\lambda x.f(x) = f</annotation></semantics></math>.  Both alpha and eta are equivalences.</p>

<p>The really important relation is the second one, &#8220;beta reduction&#8221;.  In order to define beta reduction, we have to define the <i>free</i> variables of a term: a variable occurring by itself is free; the set of free variables in an application is the union of the free variables in its subterms; and the free variables in a lambda abstraction are the free variables of the subterm except for the abstracted variable.

<p>We say a term has a normal form if there&#8217;s some sequence of beta reductions that leads to a term where no beta reduction is possible.  When the beta rule applies in more than one place in a term, it doesn&#8217;t matter which one you choose to do first: any sequence of betas that leads to a normal form will lead to the same normal form.  This property of beta reduction is called <i>confluence</i>.  Confluence means that the order of performing various subcomputations doesn&#8217;t matter so long as they all finish: in the expression <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>5</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>*</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>6</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>(2 + 5) * (3 + 6)</annotation></semantics></math> it doesn&#8217;t matter which addition you do first or whether you distribute the expressions over each other; the answer is the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;Running&#8221; a program in the lambda calculus is the process of computing the normal form by repeated application of beta reduction, and the normal form itself is the result of the computation.  Confluence, however, does not mean that when there is more than one place we could apply beta reduction, we can choose any beta reduction and be guaranteed to reach a normal form.  The following lambda term, customarily denoted <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x003C9;</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\omega</annotation></semantics></math>, takes an input and applies it to itself:
<math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='block'><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x003C9;</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>&#x003BB;</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>.</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\omega = \lambda x.x(x)</annotation></semantics></math>

It&#8217;s an infinite loop!  Now consider this lambda term that has <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x003A9;</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\Omega</annotation></semantics></math> as a subterm:

It says, &#8220;Return the first element of the pair (identity function, <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x003A9;</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\Omega</annotation></semantics></math>)&#8221;.  If it has an answer at all, the answer should be &#8220;the identity function&#8221;.  The question of whether it has an answer becomes, &#8220;Do we try to calculate the elements of the pair before applying the projection to it?&#8221;</p>

<h3>Lazy lambda calculus</h3>

<p>Many programming languages, like Java, C, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and Lisp are &#8220;eager&#8221;: they calculate the normal form of inputs to a function before calculating the result of the function on the inputs; the expression above, implemented in any of these languages, would be an infinite loop.  Other languages, like Miranda, Lispkit, Lazy ML, and Haskell and its predecessor Orwell are &#8220;lazy&#8221; and only apply beta reduction to inputs when they are needed to complete the computation; in these languages, the result is the identity function.  Abramsky wrote a <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/files/293/lazy.pdf">48-page paper</a> about constructing a domain that captures the operational semantics of lazy lambda calculus.</p>

<p>The idea of representing operational semantics directly with higher categories originated with <a href="http://www.math.mcgill.ca/rags/WkAdj/LICS.pdf">R. A. G. Seely</a>, who suggested that beta reduction should be a 2-morphism; <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-winter2007/hilken_2lambda_calculus.ps">Barney Hilken</a> and <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00540205/file/macy.pdf">Tom Hirschowitz</a> have also contributed to looking at lambda calculus from this perspective.  In the &#8220;Rosetta stone&#8221; paper that John Baez and I wrote, we made an analogy between programs and Feynman diagrams.  The analogy is precise as far as it goes, but it&#8217;s unsatisfactory in the sense that Feynman diagrams describe processes happening over time, while Lambek and Scott mod out by the process of computation that occurs over time.  If we use 2-categories that explicitly model rewrites between terms, we get something that could potentially be interpreted with concepts from physics: types would become analogous to strings, terms would become analogous to space, and rewrites would happen over time.
 
The idea from the &#8220;algebra of terms&#8221; perspective is that we have objects <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>V</annotation></semantics></math> and <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>T</annotation></semantics></math> for variables and terms, term constructors as 1-morphisms, and the nontrivial 2-morphisms generated by beta reduction.  Seely showed that this approach works fine when you&#8217;re unconcerned with the context in which reduction can occur.  </p>

<p>This approach, however, doesn&#8217;t work for lazy lambda calculus!  Horizontal composition in a 2-category is a functor, so if a term <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>t</annotation></semantics></math> reduces to a term <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>&#x02032;</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>t&apos;</annotation></semantics></math>, then by functoriality, <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x003BB;</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>.</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\lambda x.t</annotation></semantics></math> must reduce to <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x003BB;</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>.</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>&#x02032;</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\lambda x.t&apos;</annotation></semantics></math>&#8212;but this is forbidden in the lazy lambda calculus!  Functoriality of horizontal composition is a &#8220;relativity principle&#8221; in the sense that reductions in one context are the same as reductions in any other context.  In lazy programming languages, on the other hand, the &#8220;head&#8221; context is privileged: reductions only happen here.  It&#8217;s somewhat like believing that measuring differences in temperature is like measuring differences in space, that only the difference is meaningful&#8212;and then discovering absolute zero.  When beta reduction can happen anywhere in a term, there are <i>too many 2-morphisms</i> to model lazy lambda calculus.</p>

<p>In order to model this special context, we reify it: we add a special unary term constructor <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mo lspace="verythinmathspace" rspace="0em">&#x02212;</mo><mo stretchy="false">]</mo><mo lspace="verythinmathspace">&#x0003A;</mo><mi>T</mi><mo>&#x02192;</mo><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>[&#x2d;]\colon T \to T</annotation></semantics></math> that marks contexts where reduction is allowed, then redefine beta reduction so that the term constructor <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mo lspace="verythinmathspace" rspace="0em">&#x02212;</mo><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>[&#x2d;]</annotation></semantics></math> behaves like a catalyst that enables the beta reduction to occur.  This lets us cut down the set of 2-morphisms to exactly those that are allowed in the lazy lambda calculus; Greg and I did essentially the same thing in the pi calculus.</p>

<p>More concretely, we have two generating rewrite rules.  The first propagates the reduction context to the head position of the term; the second is beta reduction <i>restricted to a reduction context</i>.

When we surround the example term from the previous section with a reduction context marker, we get the following sequence of reductions:

At the start, none of the subterms were of the right shape for beta reduction to apply.  The first two reductions propagated the reduction context down to the projection in head position.  At that point, the only reduction that could occur was at the application of the projection to the first element of the pair, and after that to the second element.  At no point was <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x003A9;</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\Omega</annotation></semantics></math> ever in a reduction context.</p>

<h3>Compute resources</h3>

<p>In order to run a program that does anything practical, you need a processor, time, memory, and perhaps disk space or a network connection or a display.  All of these resources have a cost, and it would be nice to keep track of them.  One side-effect of reifying the context is that we can use it as a resource.</p>

<p>The rewrite rule <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msub><mo stretchy="false">&#x02193;</mo> <mi>ctx</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\downarrow_{ctx}</annotation></semantics></math> increases the number of occurrences of <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mo lspace="verythinmathspace" rspace="0em">&#x02212;</mo><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>[&#x2d;]</annotation></semantics></math> in a term while <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msub><mo stretchy="false">&#x02193;</mo> <mi>&#x003B2;</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\downarrow_\beta</annotation></semantics></math> decreases the number.  If we replace <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msub><mo stretchy="false">&#x02193;</mo> <mi>ctx</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\downarrow_{ctx}</annotation></semantics></math> by the rule
<math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='block'><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>&#x02032;</mo><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">]</mo><mspace width="thinmathspace"/><msub><mo stretchy="false">&#x02193;</mo> <mrow><mi>ctx</mi><mo>&#x02032;</mo></mrow></msub><mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy="false">]</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>&#x02032;</mo><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>  [t(t&apos;)]\, \downarrow_{ctx&apos;}\, [t](t&apos;)  </annotation></semantics></math>
then the number of occurences of <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mo lspace="verythinmathspace" rspace="0em">&#x02212;</mo><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>[&#x2d;]</annotation></semantics></math> can never increase.  By forming the term <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mi>&#x022EF;</mi><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy="false">]</mo><mi>&#x022EF;</mi><mo stretchy="false">]</mo><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>[[\cdots[t]\cdots]]</annotation></semantics></math>, we can bound the number of beta reductions that can occur in the computation of <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>t</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

<p>If we have a nullary constructor <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo lspace="verythinmathspace">&#x0003A;</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>&#x02192;</mo><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>c\colon 1 \to T</annotation></semantics></math>, then we can define <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy="false">]</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>c</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>[t] = c(t)</annotation></semantics></math> and let the program dynamically decide whether to evaluate an expression eagerly or lazily.</p>

<p>In the pi calculus, we have the ability to run multiple processes at the same time; each <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mo lspace="verythinmathspace" rspace="0em">&#x02212;</mo><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>[&#x2d;]</annotation></semantics></math> in that situation represents a core in a processor or computer in a network.</p>

<p>These are just the first things that come to mind; we&#8217;re experimenting with variations.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>We figured out how to model the operational semantics of a term calculus directly in a 2-category by requiring a catalyst to carry out a rewrite, which gave us full abstraction without needing a domain based on representing all the possible futures of a term.  As a side-effect, it also gave us a new tool for modeling resource consumption in the process of computation.  Though I haven&#8217;t explained how yet, there&#8217;s a nice connection between the &#8220;algebra-of-terms&#8221; approach that uses <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>V</annotation></semantics></math> and <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>T</annotation></semantics></math> as objects and Lambek and Scott&#8217;s approach that uses types as objects, based on Melli&#x000E8;s and Zeilberger&#8217;s ideas about type refinement.  Next time, I&#8217;ll talk about the pi calculus and types.</p>

<p>Following <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2014/10/competing_foundations_conferen.html">SoTFom II</a>, which managed to feature three talks on Homotopy Type Theory, there is now a call for papers announced for <strong>SoTFoM III and The Hyperuniverse Programme</strong>, to be held in Vienna, September 21-23, 2015.</p>

<p>Here are the details:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Hyperuniverse Programme, launched in 2012, and currently pursued within a Templeton-funded research project at the Kurt Gdel Research Center in Vienna, aims to identify and philosophically motivate the adoption of new set-theoretic axioms.</p>

<p>The programme intersects several topics in the philosophy of set theory and of mathematics, such as the nature of mathematical (set-theoretic) truth, the universe/multiverse dichotomy, the alternative conceptions of the set-theoretic multiverse, the conceptual and epistemological status of new axioms and their alternative justificatory frameworks.</p>

<p>The aim of SotFoM III+The Hyperuniverse Programme Joint Conference is to bring together scholars who, over the last years, have contributed mathematically and philosophically to the ongoing work and debate on the foundations and the philosophy of set theory, in particular, to the understanding and the elucidation of the aforementioned topics. The three-day conference, taking place September 21-23 at the KGRC in Vienna, will feature invited and contributed speakers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder if anyone will bring some category theory along to the meeting. Perhaps they can answer my question <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/q/75836/447">here</a>.</p>

<p>PROPs were developed in topology, along with operads, to describe spaces with lots of operations on them.  But now some of us are using them to think about &#8216;signal-flow diagrams&#8217; in control theory&#8212;an important branch of engineering.  I talked about that <a href = "https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2015/04/categories_in_control.html">here on the <i>n</i>-Caf&#x000E9;</a> a while ago, but it&#8217;s time for an update.</p>
<div><a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/mathml.html"><img class="mathlogo" src="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/images/MathML.png" alt="MathML-enabled post (click for more details)." title="MathML-enabled post (click for details)." /></a></div>
<p>Eric Drexler likes to say: engineering is dual to science, because science tries to understand what the world does, while engineering is about getting the world to do what you want.  I think we need a slightly less &#8216;coercive&#8217;, more &#8216;cooperative&#8217; approach to the world in order to develop &#8216;ecotechnology&#8217;, but it&#8217;s still a useful distinction.</p>

<p>For example, classical mechanics is the study of what things do when they follow Newton&#8217;s laws.  Control theory is the study of <i>what you can get them to do.</i>  </p>

<p>Say you have an upside-down pendulum on a cart.  Classical mechanics says what it will do.  But control theory says: if you watch the pendulum and use what you see to move the cart back and forth correctly, <i>you can make sure the pendulum doesn&#8217;t fall over!</i></p>

<p>Control theorists do their work with the help of &#8216;signal-flow diagrams&#8217;.  For example, here is the signal-flow diagram for an inverted pendulum on a cart:</p>

<p><img src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/inverted_pendulum.jpg" alt = "" /></p>

<p>When I take a look at a diagram like this, I say to myself: <i>that&#8217;s a string diagram for a morphism in a monoidal category!</i>  And it&#8217;s true.  Jason Erbele wrote a paper explaining this.  Independently, Bonchi, Soboci&#324;ski and Zanasi did some closely related work:</p>

<p>&#x02022; John Baez and Jason Erbele, <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/23/categories-in-control-2/">Categories in control</a>.</p>

<p>&#x02022; Filippo Bonchi, Pawe&#322; Soboci&#324;ski and Fabio Zanasi, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.7048">Interacting Hopf algebras</a>.</p>

<p>&#x02022; Filippo Bonchi, Pawe&#322; Soboci&#324;ski and Fabio Zanasi, <a href="http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/ps/papers/sfg.pdf">A categorical semantics of signal flow graphs</a>.</p>

<p>Next week I&#8217;ll explain some of the ideas at the <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks_isi/">Turin meeting</a> on the categorical foundations of network theory.  But I also want to talk about this new paper that <a href="https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~sjw47/">Simon Wadsley</a> of Cambridge University wrote with my student <a href="http://mathdept.ucr.edu/gradwebpages/woods.html">Nick Woods</a>:</p>

<p>&#x02022; Simon Wadsley and Nick Woods, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00048">PROPs for linear systems</a>.</p>

<p>This makes the picture neater and more general!</p>

<p>You see, Jason and I used signal flow diagrams to give a new description of the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces and linear maps.  This category plays a big role in the control theory of linear systems.  Bonchi, Soboci&#324;ski and Zanasi gave a closely related description of an equivalent category, <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Mat</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>k</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> \mathrm{Mat}(k),</annotation></semantics></math> where:</p>

<p>&#x02022; objects are natural numbers, and</p>

<p>&#x02022; a morphism <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>m</mi><mo>&#x02192;</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> f : m \to n</annotation></semantics></math> is an <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>&#x000D7;</mo><mi>m</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> n \times m</annotation></semantics></math> matrix with entries in the field <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> k,</annotation></semantics></math></p>

<p>and composition is given by matrix multiplication.  </p>

<p>But Wadsley and Woods generalized all this work to cover <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Mat</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>R</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\mathrm{Mat}(R)</annotation></semantics></math> whenever <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> R</annotation></semantics></math> is a commutative rig.   A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring"><b>rig</b></a> is a &#8216;ring without negatives&#8217;&#8212;like the natural numbers.  We can multiply matrices valued in any rig, and this includes some very useful examples&#8230; as I&#8217;ll explain later.</p>

<p>Wadsley and Woods proved:</p>

<p><b>Theorem.</b> Whenever <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> R</annotation></semantics></math> is a commutative rig, <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Mat</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>R</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> \mathrm{Mat}(R)</annotation></semantics></math> is the PROP for bicommutative bimonoids over <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> R.</annotation></semantics></math>  </p>

<p>This result is quick to state, but it takes a bit of explaining!  So, let me start by bringing in some definitions.  </p>

<h3> Bicommutative bimonoids </h3>

<p>We will work in any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_monoidal_category">symmetric monoidal category</a>, and draw morphisms as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_diagram">string diagrams</a>.  </p>

<p>A <b>commutative monoid</b> is an object equipped with a <b>multiplication</b>:</p>

<p><img width="90" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_addition.jpg" alt = "" /></p>

<p>and a <b>unit</b>:</p>

<p><img width="60" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_zero.jpg" alt = "" /></p>

<p>obeying these laws:</p>

<p><img width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_commutative_monoid.jpg" alt = "" /></p>

<p>For example, suppose <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">FinVect</mi> <mi>k</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> \mathrm{FinVect}_k</annotation></semantics></math> is the symmetric monoidal category of finite-dimensional vector spaces over a field <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> k</annotation></semantics></math>, with <i>direct sum</i> as its tensor product.  Then any object <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>&#x02208;</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">FinVect</mi> <mi>k</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> V \in \mathrm{FinVect}_k </annotation></semantics></math> is a commutative monoid where the multiplication is <b>addition</b>:</p>

<p><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>&#x021A6;</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> (x,y) \mapsto x + y </annotation></semantics></math></p>

<p>and the unit is <b>zero</b>: that is, the unique map from the zero-dimensional vector space to <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> V.</annotation></semantics></math></p>

<p>Turning all this upside down, <b>cocommutative comonoid</b> has a <b>comultiplication</b>:</p>

<p><img width="110" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_diagonal.jpg" alt = "" /></p>

<p>and a <b>counit</b>:</p>

<p><img width="50" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_deletion.jpg" alt = "" /></p>

<p>obeying these laws:</p>

<p><img width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_cocommutative_comonoid.jpg" alt = "" /></p>

<p>For example, consider our vector space <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>&#x02208;</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">FinVect</mi> <mi>k</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> V \in \mathrm{FinVect}_k</annotation></semantics></math> again.  It&#8217;s a commutative comonoid where the comultiplication is <b>duplication</b>:</p>

<p><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>&#x021A6;</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> x \mapsto (x,x) </annotation></semantics></math></p>

<p>and the counit is <b>deletion</b>: that is, the unique map from <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> V</annotation></semantics></math> to the zero-dimensional vector space.</p>

<p>Given an object that&#8217;s both a commutative monoid and a cocommutative comonoid, we say it&#8217;s a <b>bicommutative bimonoid</b> if these extra axioms hold:</p>

<p><img width="150" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_bimonoid_1.jpg" alt = "" /></p>

<p><img width="300" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_bimonoid_2.jpg" alt = "" /></p>

<p>You can check that these are true for our running example of a finite-dimensional vector space <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> V.</annotation></semantics></math>  The most exciting one is the top one, which says that adding two vectors and then duplicating the result is the same as duplicating each one, then adding them appropriately.</p>

<p>Our example has some other properties, too!  Each element <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>&#x02208;</mo><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> c \in k</annotation></semantics></math> defines a morphism from <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> V</annotation></semantics></math> to itself, namely scalar multiplication by <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>:</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> c:</annotation></semantics></math></p>

<p><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>&#x021A6;</mo><mi>c</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> x \mapsto c x </annotation></semantics></math></p>

<p>We draw this as follows:</p>

<p><img width="60" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_scalar_mult.jpg" alt = "" /></p>

<p>These morphisms are compatible with the ones so far:</p>

<p><img width="300" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_linearity_1.jpg" alt = "" /></p>

<p><img width="300" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_linearity_2.jpg" alt = "" /></p>

<p>Moreover, all the &#8216;rig operations&#8217; in <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> k</annotation></semantics></math>&#8212;that is, addition, multiplication, 0 and 1, but not subtraction or division&#8212;can be recovered from what we have so far:</p>

<p><img width="300" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_rig_1.jpg" alt = "" /></p>

<p><img width="200" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_rig_2.jpg" alt = "" /></p>

<p>We summarize this by saying our vector space <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> V</annotation></semantics></math> is a bicommutative bimonoid &#8216;over <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> k</annotation></semantics></math>&#8217;. </p>

<p>More generally, suppose we have a bicommutative bimonoid <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> A</annotation></semantics></math> in a symmetric monoidal category.  Let <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">End</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> \mathrm{End}(A)</annotation></semantics></math> be the set of bicommutative bimonoid homomorphisms from <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> A</annotation></semantics></math> to itself.  This is actually a rig: there&#8217;s a way to add these homomorphisms, and also a way to &#8216;multiply&#8217; them (namely, <i>compose</i> them).  </p>

<p>Suppose <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> R</annotation></semantics></math> is any commutative rig.  Then we say <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> A</annotation></semantics></math> is a bicommutative bimonoid <b>over <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> R</annotation></semantics></math></b> if it&#8217;s equipped with a rig homomorphism </p>

<p><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x003A6;</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>R</mi><mo>&#x02192;</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">End</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> \Phi : R \to \mathrm{End}(A)</annotation></semantics></math></p>

<p>This is a way of summarizing the diagrams I just showed you!  You see, each <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>&#x02208;</mo><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> c \in R</annotation></semantics></math> gives a morphism from <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> A</annotation></semantics></math> to itself, which we write as </p>

<p><img width="60" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_scalar_mult.jpg" alt = "" /></p>

<p>The fact that this is a bicommutative bimonoid endomorphism says precisely this:</p>

<p><img width="300" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_linearity_1.jpg" alt = "" /></p>

<p><img width="300" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_linearity_2.jpg" alt = "" /></p>

<p>And the fact that <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x003A6;</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> \Phi</annotation></semantics></math> is a rig homomorphism says precisely this:</p>

<p><img width="300" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_rig_1.jpg" alt = "" /></p>

<p><img width="200" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_rig_2.jpg" alt = "" /></p>

<p>So sometimes the right word is worth a dozen pictures!</p>

<p>What Jason and I showed is that for any field <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> k,</annotation></semantics></math> the <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">FinVect</mi> <mi>k</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> \mathrm{FinVect}_k</annotation></semantics></math> is the free symmetric monoidal category on a bicommutative bimonoid over <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> k.</annotation></semantics></math>  This means that the above rules, which are rules for manipulating signal flow diagrams, <i>completely characterize the world of linear algebra!</i></p>

<p>Bonchi, Soboci&#324;ski and Zanasi used &#8216;PROPs&#8217; to prove a similar result where the field is replaced by a sufficiently nice commutative ring.  And Wadlsey and Woods used PROPS to generalize even further to the case of an arbitrary commutative <i>rig!</i></p>

<p>But what are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRO_%28category_theory%29">PROPs</a>?</p>

<h3> PROPs </h3>

<p>A <b>PROP</b> is a particularly tractable sort of symmetric monoidal category: a strict symmetric monoidal category where the objects are natural numbers and the tensor product of objects is given by ordinary addition.  The symmetric monoidal category <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">FinVect</mi> <mi>k</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> \mathrm{FinVect}_k</annotation></semantics></math> is equivalent to the PROP <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Mat</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>k</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> \mathrm{Mat}(k),</annotation></semantics></math> where a morphism <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>m</mi><mo>&#x02192;</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> f : m \to n</annotation></semantics></math> is an <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>&#x000D7;</mo><mi>m</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> n \times m</annotation></semantics></math> matrix with entries in <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> k,</annotation></semantics></math> composition of morphisms is given by matrix multiplication, and the tensor product of morphisms is the direct sum of matrices.</p>

<p>We can define a similar PROP <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Mat</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>R</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> \mathrm{Mat}(R)</annotation></semantics></math> whenever <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> R</annotation></semantics></math> is a commutative rig, and  Wadsley and Woods gave an elegant description of the &#8216;algebras&#8217; of <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Mat</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>R</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> \mathrm{Mat}(R)</annotation></semantics></math>.  Suppose <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> C</annotation></semantics></math> is a PROP and <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> D</annotation></semantics></math> is a strict symmetric monoidal category.  Then the <b>category of algebras of <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> C</annotation></semantics></math> in <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> D</annotation></semantics></math></b> is the category of strict symmetric monoidal functors <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>&#x02192;</mo><mi>D</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> F : C \to D</annotation></semantics></math> and natural transformations between these.  </p>

<p>If for every choice of <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> D</annotation></semantics></math> the category of algebras of <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> C</annotation></semantics></math> in <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> D</annotation></semantics></math> is equivalent to the category of algebraic structures of some kind in <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>D</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> D,</annotation></semantics></math> we say <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> C</annotation></semantics></math> is the PROP for structures of that kind.  This explains the theorem Wadsley and Woods proved:</p>

<p><b>Theorem.</b> Whenever <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> R</annotation></semantics></math> is a commutative rig, <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Mat</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>R</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> \mathrm{Mat}(R)</annotation></semantics></math> is the PROP for bicommutative bimonoids over <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> R.</annotation></semantics></math>  </p>

<p><img width="200" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_rig_2.jpg" alt = "" /></p>

<p>This is a great result because it includes some nice new examples.  </p>

<p>First, the commutative rig of natural numbers gives a PROP <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Mat</mi><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> \mathrm{Mat}.</annotation></semantics></math>  This is equivalent to the symmetric monoidal category <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">FinSpan</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> \mathrm{FinSpan},</annotation></semantics></math> where morphisms are isomorphism classes of spans of finite sets, with disjoint union as the tensor product.  Steve Lack had already shown that <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">FinSpan</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> \mathrm{FinSpan}</annotation></semantics></math> is the PROP for bicommutative bimonoids.  But this also follows from the result of Wadsley and Woods, since every bicommutative bimonoid <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> V</annotation></semantics></math> is automatically equipped with a unique rig homomorphism </p>

<p><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x003A6;</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>&#x02115;</mi><mo>&#x02192;</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">End</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>V</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> \Phi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathrm{End}(V)</annotation></semantics></math>  </p>

<p>Second, the commutative rig of booleans </p>

<p><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x1D539;</mi><mo>=</mo><mo stretchy="false">{</mo><mi>F</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy="false">}</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> \mathbb{B} = \{F,T\}</annotation></semantics></math> </p>

<p>with &#8216;or&#8217; as addition and &#8216;and&#8217; as multiplication gives a PROP <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Mat</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>&#x1D539;</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> \mathrm{Mat}(\mathbb{B}).</annotation></semantics></math>  This is equivalent to the symmetric monoidal category <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">FinRel</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> \mathrm{FinRel}</annotation></semantics></math> where morphisms are relations between finite sets, with disjoint union as the tensor product.  Samuel Mimram had already shown that this is the PROP for <b>special</b> bicommutative bimonoids, meaning those where comultiplication followed by multiplication is the identity:</p>

<p><img width="100" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_special_bimonoid.jpg" alt = "" /></p>

<p>But again, this follows from the general result of Wadsley and Woods!</p>

<p>Finally, taking the commutative ring of integers <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x02124;</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> \mathbb{Z},</annotation></semantics></math> Wadsley and Woods showed that <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Mat</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>&#x02124;</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> \mathrm{Mat}(\mathbb{Z})</annotation></semantics></math> is the PROP for bicommutative Hopf monoids.  The key here is that scalar multiplication by <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mo lspace="verythinmathspace" rspace="0em">&#x02212;</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> &#x2d;1</annotation></semantics></math> obeys the axioms for an <b>antipode</b>&#8212;the extra morphism that makes a bimonoid into a <b>Hopf monoid</b>. Here are those axioms:</p>

<p><img width="250" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_antipode.jpg" alt = "" /></p>

<p>More generally, whenever <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> R</annotation></semantics></math> is a commutative ring, the presence of <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mo lspace="verythinmathspace" rspace="0em">&#x02212;</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>&#x02208;</mo><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> &#x2d;1 \in R</annotation></semantics></math> guarantees that a bimonoid over <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> R</annotation></semantics></math> is automatically a Hopf monoid over <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> R.</annotation></semantics></math> So, when <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> R</annotation></semantics></math> is a commutative ring, Wadsley and Woods&#8217; result implies that <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Mat</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>R</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> \mathrm{Mat}(R)</annotation></semantics></math> is the PROP for Hopf monoids over <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> R.</annotation></semantics></math>  </p>

<p>Earlier, in their paper on &#8216;interacting Hopf algebras&#8217;, Bonchi, Soboci&#324;ski and Zanasi had given an elegant and very different proof that <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Mat</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>R</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> \mathrm{Mat}(R)</annotation></semantics></math> is the PROP for Hopf monoids over <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> R</annotation></semantics></math> whenever <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> R</annotation></semantics></math> is a principal ideal domain.  The advantage of their argument is that they build up the PROP for Hopf monoids over <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> R</annotation></semantics></math> from smaller pieces, using some ideas developed by Steve Lack.  But the new argument by Wadsley and Woods has its own charm.</p>

<p>In short, we&#8217;re getting the diagrammatics of linear algebra worked out very nicely, providing a solid mathematical foundation for signal flow diagrams in control theory! </p>

<p>A <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2015/02/more_on_the_ams_and_nsa.html#c049064">comment today</a> by <a href="http://math.uakron.edu/~sf34/">Stefan Forcey</a> points out ways in which US citizens can try to place legal limits on the surveillance powers of the National Security Agency, which we were discussing in the context of its links with the American Mathematical Society.  If you want to act, time is of the essence!</p>

<p>But Stefan also <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2015/02/more_on_the_ams_and_nsa.html#c049064">tells us</a> how he resolved a dilemma.  <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2014/02/the_deteriorating_relationship.html#c045817">Back here</a>, he asked Caf patrons what he should do about the fact that the NSA was offering him a grant (for non-classified work).  Take their money and contribute to the normalization of the NSA&#8217;s presence within the math community, or refuse it and cause less mathematics to be created?</p>

<p>What he decided was to accept the funding and &#x02014; in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05536">this paper</a> at least &#x02014; include a kind of protesting acknowledgement, citing his previous <a href="http://www.ams.org//notices/201401/rnoti-p7.pdf">article for the <em>Notices of the AMS</em></a>. </p>

<p>I admire Stefan for openly discussing his dilemma, and I think there&#8217;s a lot to be said for how he&#8217;s handled it.</p>

<p>A <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racks_and_quandles">quandle</a> is a set equipped with a binary operation with number of properties, the most important being that it distributes over itself:</p>

<p><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='block'><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>&#x025B9;</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>&#x025B9;</mo><mi>c</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>&#x025B9;</mo><mi>b</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>&#x025B9;</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>&#x025B9;</mo><mi>c</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> a \triangleright (b \triangleright c) = (a  \triangleright b)\triangleright (a  \triangleright  c) </annotation></semantics></math></p>

<p>They show up in knot theory, where the operation <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mo>&#x025B9;</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\triangleright</annotation></semantics></math> describes what happens when one strand crosses over another&#8230; and the laws are chosen so that the quandle gives an <i>invariant</i> of a knot, independent of how you draw it.  Even better, the quandle is a complete invariant of knots: if two knots have isomorphic quandles, there&#8217;s a diffeomorphism of <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>&#x0211D;</mi> <mn>3</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\mathbb{R}^3</annotation></semantics></math> mapping one knot to the other.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always wondered where the name &#8216;quandle&#8217; came from.  So I decided to ask their inventor, <a href = "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022404982900779/pdf?md5=cc81b2cf5a01afc9277d58d10128878a&amp;pid=1-s2.0-0022404982900779-main.pdf">David Joyce</a>&#8212;who also proved the theorem I just mentioned.</p>

<p>He replied:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I needed a usable word.  &#8220;Distributive algebra&#8221; had too many syllables. Piffle was already taken. I tried trindle and quagle, but they didn&#8217;t seem right, so I went with quandle. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>So there you go!  Another mystery unraveled.</p>

<p>After a discussion with Michael Harris over at the blog about his book <a href="https://mathematicswithoutapologies.wordpress.com/">Mathematics without apologies</a>, I realized that there is a lot of confusion surrounding the relationship between homotopy type theory and computer formalization &#8212; and that moreover, this confusion may be causing people to react negatively to one or the other due to incorrect associations.  There are good reasons to be confused, because the relationship is complicated, and various statements by prominent members of both communities about a &#8220;revolution&#8221; haven&#8217;t helped matters.  This post and its sequel(s) are my attempt to clear things up.</p>

<div><a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/mathml.html"><img class="mathlogo" src="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/images/MathML.png" alt="MathML-enabled post (click for more details)." title="MathML-enabled post (click for details)." /></a></div>

<p>In this post I will talk mainly about computer formalization of mathematics, independently of homotopy type theory.  There are multiple applications of computers to mathematics, and people sometimes confuse computer <em>verification</em> of proofs with computerized <em>automated proof-finding</em>.  Homotopy type theory has very little to do with the latter, so henceforth by &#8220;formalization&#8221; I will mean only the <em>verification</em> of proofs.</p>

<p>This often means the verification of <em>pre-existing</em> proofs, but it is also possible to use a computer to help construct a proof and verify it at the same time.  The tools that we use to verify proofs incorporate a small amount of automation, so that this process can sometimes save a small amount of effort over writing a proof by hand first; but at least in the realm of pure mathematics, the automation mainly serves to save us from worrying about details that the computer cares about but that we wouldn&#8217;t have worried about in a paper proof anyway.</p>

<p>Computer-verified proof has been going on for decades.  Recently it&#8217;s garnered a bit more attention, due partly to complete verifications of some &#8220;big-name&#8221; theorems such as the four-color theorem, the odd-order theorem, and the Kepler conjecture, whose proofs were so long or complicated or automated that reasonable mathematicians might wonder whether there was an error somewhere.</p>

<p>What is the future of computer-verified proof?  Is it the future of mathematics?  Should we be happy or worried about that prospect?  Does it mean that computers will take over mathematics and leave no room for the humans?  My personal opinion is that (1) computer-verified proof is only going to get more common and important, but (2) it will be a <em>long time</em> before all mathematics is computer-verified, if indeed that ever happens, and (3) if and when it does happen, it won&#8217;t be anything to worry about.</p>

<p>The reason I believe (2) is that my personal experience with computer proof assistants leads me to the conclusion that they are still very far from usable by the average mathematician on a daily basis.  Despite all the fancy tools that exist now, verifying a proof with a computer is usually still a <em>lot</em> more work than writing that proof on paper.  And that&#8217;s <em>after</em> you spend the necessary time and effort learning to use the proof assistant tool, which generally comes with quite a passel of idiosyncracies.</p>

<p>Moreover, in most cases the benefits to verifying a proof with a computer are doubtful.  For big theorems that are very long or complicated or automated, so that their authors have a hard time convincing other mathematicians of their correctness by hand, there&#8217;s a clear win.  (That&#8217;s one of the reasons I believe (1), because I believe that proofs of this sort are also going to get more common.)  Moreover, a certain kind of mathematician finds proof verification fun and rewarding for its own sake.  But for the everyday proof by your average mathematician, which can be read and understood by any other average mathematician, the benefit from sweating long hours to convince a computer of its truth is just not there (yet).  That&#8217;s why, despite periodic messianic claims from various quarters, you don&#8217;t see mathematicians jumping on any bandwagon of proof verification.</p>

<p>Now there <em>would</em> be certain benefits to the mathematical community if all proofs were computer verified.  Notably, of course, we could be sure that they were correct.  If all submissions to journals were verified first by their authors, then referees could be mostly absolved of checking the correctness of the results and could focus on exposition and interest.  (There are still certain things to check, however, such as that the computer formalization does in fact prove what the paper claims that it does.)</p>

<p>I can imagine that once there is a &#8220;critical mass&#8221; of mathematicians <em>choosing</em> to verify their own results with a computer, journals might start requiring such verification, thereby tipping the balance completely towards all mathematics being verified, in the same way that many journals now require submissions in (La)TeX.  However, we&#8217;re a long way from that critical mass, because proof assistants have a long way to go before they are as easy to use as TeX.  My guess is that it will take about 100 years, if it happens at all.  Moreover, it won&#8217;t be a &#8220;revolution&#8221; in the sense of a sudden overthrow of the status quo.  Historians might look back on it afterwards and call it a revolution, but at the time when it happens it will feel like a natural and gradual process.</p>

<p>As for (3), for the most part computer verification is just a <em>supplement</em> to ordinary mathematical reasoning.  It&#8217;s a tool used by human mathematicians.  We have to learn to use it correctly, and establish certain conventions, such as the fact that you&#8217;ve verified a proof with a computer doesn&#8217;t absolve you from explaining it clearly to humans.  But I have faith that the mathematical community will be up to that task, and I don&#8217;t see any point in worrying right now about things that are so far in the future we can barely imagine them.  (And no, I don&#8217;t believe in the AI singularity either.)</p>

<p>(Next time: What about HoTT?)</p>

<p>Tom Leinster introduced the idea of the magnitude of graphs (first at the <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2013/04/tutte_polynomials_and_magnitud.html">Caf&#x000E9;</a> and then in a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4623">paper</a>).  I&#8217;ve been working with my mathematical brother <a href="http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/r.hepworth/pages/">Richard Hepworth</a> on  categorifying this and our paper has just appeared on the arXiv.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04125">Categorifying the magnitude of a graph</a>, Richard Hepworth and Simon Willerton.</p>

<p>The magnitude of a graph can be thought of as an integer power series. For example, consider the Petersen graph.</p>

So graph magnitude homology categorifies graph magnitude in the same sense that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khovanov_homology">Khovanov homology</a> categorifies the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_polynomial">Jones polynomial</a>.</p>

<p>For instance, for the Petersen graph, the ranks of <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">MH</mi> <mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>l</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>P</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\mathrm{MH}_{k,l}(P)</annotation></semantics></math> are given in the following table.

<h2>The definition</h2>

<p>Let&#8217;s have a quick look at the definition first: this is a typical piece of homological algebra.  For each graph <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>G</annotation></semantics></math> we define a <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k</annotation></semantics></math>-chain on <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>G</annotation></semantics></math> to be a <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k+1</annotation></semantics></math>-tuple of vertices of <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>G</annotation></semantics></math> such that adjacent vertices are distinct:

 Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t know of any intuitive interpretation of the chain groups.</p>

<h2>Functoriality</h2>

<p>One standard advantage of this sort of categorification is that it has functoriality where the original invariant did not. We don&#8217;t usually have morphisms between numbers or polynomials, but we do have morphisms between groups. In the case here we have the category of graphs with the morphisms sending vertices to vertices with edges either preserved or contracted, and graph magnitude homology gives a functor from that to the category of bigraded groups and homomorphisms.</p>

<h2>Categorifying properties of magnitude</h2>

<p>Here are some of the properties of magnitude that we can categorify. With the exception of disjoint unions, all of the other categorification results require some decidedly non-trivial homological algebra to prove.</p>

<h3>Disjoint unions</h3>

<p>Tom showed that magnitude is additive with respect to the disjoint union of graphs:
<math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='block'><semantics><mrow><mo>#</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>G</mi><mo>&#x02294;</mo><mi>H</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mo>#</mo><mi>G</mi><mo>+</mo><mo>#</mo><mi>H</mi><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>
#(G\sqcup H) = #G + #H.
</annotation></semantics></math>
 Our categorification of this is the additivity of the magnitude homology:
<math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='block'><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">MH</mi> <mrow><mo>&#x0002A;</mo><mo>,</mo><mo>&#x0002A;</mo></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>G</mi><mo>&#x02294;</mo><mi>H</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>&#x02245;</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">MH</mi> <mrow><mo>&#x0002A;</mo><mo>,</mo><mo>&#x0002A;</mo></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>G</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>&#x02295;</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">MH</mi> <mrow><mo>&#x0002A;</mo><mo>,</mo><mo>&#x0002A;</mo></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>H</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>
\mathrm{MH}_{\ast ,\ast }(G\sqcup H) \cong \mathrm{MH}_{\ast ,\ast }(G) \oplus \mathrm{MH}_{\ast ,\ast }(H).
</annotation></semantics></math></p>

<h3>Products</h3>

<p>Tom showed that magnitude is multiplicative with respect to the cartesian product <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mo>&#x025A1;</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\square</annotation></semantics></math> of graphs
<math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='block'><semantics><mrow><mo>#</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>G</mi><mo>&#x025A1;</mo><mi>H</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mo>#</mo><mi>G</mi><mo>&#x022C5;</mo><mo>#</mo><mi>H</mi><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>
#(G\Box H) = #G\cdot #H.
</annotation></semantics></math>
 The categorification of this is a K&#x000FC;nneth Theorem which says that there is a non-naturally split, short exact sequence:
<math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='block'><semantics><mrow><mrow><mtable displaystyle="true" columnalign="right left right left right left right left right left" columnspacing="0em"><mtr><mtd><mn>0</mn><mo>&#x02192;</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">MH</mi> <mrow><mo>&#x0002A;</mo><mo>,</mo><mo>&#x0002A;</mo></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>G</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>&#x02297;</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">MH</mi> <mrow><mo>&#x0002A;</mo><mo>,</mo><mo>&#x0002A;</mo></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>H</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>&#x02192;</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">MH</mi> <mrow><mo>&#x0002A;</mo><mo>,</mo><mo>&#x0002A;</mo></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>G</mi><mo>&#x025A1;</mo><mi>H</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mtd></mtr> <mtr><mtd><mo>&#x02192;</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">Tor</mi><mo maxsize="1.2em" minsize="1.2em">(</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">MH</mi> <mrow><mo>&#x0002A;</mo><mo lspace="verythinmathspace" rspace="0em">+</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><mo>&#x0002A;</mo></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>G</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>,</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">MH</mi> <mrow><mo>&#x0002A;</mo><mo>,</mo><mo>&#x0002A;</mo></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>H</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo maxsize="1.2em" minsize="1.2em">)</mo><mo>&#x02192;</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>.</mo></mtd></mtr></mtable></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>
\begin{aligned}
 0\to \mathrm{MH}_{\ast ,\ast }(G)\otimes \mathrm{MH}_{\ast ,\ast }(H) \to \mathrm{MH}_{\ast ,\ast }(G\square H)\\ \to \mathrm{Tor}\bigl (\mathrm{MH}_{\ast +1,\ast }(G), \mathrm{MH}_{\ast ,\ast }(H)\bigr ) \to 0.
\end{aligned}
</annotation></semantics></math>
 If either <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>G</annotation></semantics></math> or <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>H</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>H</annotation></semantics></math> has torsion-free magnitude homology, then this sequence reduces to an isomorphism

\mathrm{MH}_{\ast ,\ast }(G{\square }H)\cong \mathrm{MH}_{\ast ,\ast }(G)\otimes \mathrm{MH}_{\ast ,\ast }(H).
</annotation></semantics></math>
 Despite quite a bit of computation, we don&#8217;t know whether any graphs have torsion in their magnitude homology.</p>

<h3>Unions</h3>

<p>Tom showed that a form of the inclusion-exclusion formula holds for certain graphs. We need a pile of definitions first.</p>

In this case the magnitude is given by
<math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='block'><semantics><mrow><mo>#</mo><mi>G</mi><mo>=</mo><munder><mo lspace="thinmathspace" rspace="thinmathspace">&#x02211;</mo> <mrow><mi>l</mi><mo>&#x02265;</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></munder><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mo lspace="verythinmathspace" rspace="0em">&#x02212;</mo><mn>1</mn><msup><mo stretchy="false">)</mo> <mi>l</mi></msup><mo>&#x022C5;</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">rank</mi><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">MH</mi> <mrow><mi>l</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>l</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>G</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>&#x022C5;</mo><msup><mi>q</mi> <mi>l</mi></msup><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>
#G=\sum _{l\geq 0}(&#x2d;1)^{l}\cdot \mathrm{rank}\mathrm{MH}_{l,l}(G)\cdot q^{l},
</annotation></semantics></math>
 and it means in particular that the coefficients of the magnitude alternate in sign.</p>

<p>The join <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi><mo>&#x022C6;</mo><mi>H</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>G\star H</annotation></semantics></math> of graphs <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>G</annotation></semantics></math> and <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>H</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>H</annotation></semantics></math> is obtained by adding an edge between every vertex of <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>G</annotation></semantics></math> and every vertex of <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>H</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>H</annotation></semantics></math>. This is a very drastic operation, for instance the diameter of the resulting join is at most <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>2</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem.</strong>    If <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>G</annotation></semantics></math> and <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>H</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>H</annotation></semantics></math> are non-empty graphs then the join <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi><mo>&#x022C6;</mo><mi>H</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>G\star H</annotation></semantics></math> is diagonal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This tells us immediately that complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs are diagonal. Together with the other properties of magnitude homology mentioned above, we recover the alternating magnitude property of all the graphs noted by Leinster, as well as many more.</p>

<p>However, there is one graph that appears to be diagonal, at least up to degree <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mn>7</mn></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>7</annotation></semantics></math> according to our computer calculations but which we can&#8217;t prove is diagonal, i.e.&#x000A0;it doesn&#8217;t follow from the results above. This graph is the icosahedron graph which is the one-skeleton of the icosahedron.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h2>Where next?</h2>

<p>There are plenty of questions that you can ask about magnitude homology, a fundamental one is whether there are graphs with the same magnitude but different magnitude homology and a related one is whether you can categorify <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2013/07/whitney_twists.html">Tom&#8217;s result</a> (conjectured by me and David Speyer) on the magnitude of graphs which differ by certain Whitney twists.</p>

<p>One interesting thing demonstrated here is that magnitude has its tendrils in homological algebra, yet another area of mathematics to add to the list which includes biodiversity, enriched category theory, curvature and Minkowski dimension.</p>

<p><i>To understand ecosystems, ultimately will be to understand networks.</i> - B. C. Patten and M. Witkamp</p>

</blockquote>

<p>A while back I decided one way to apply my math skills to help save the planet was to start pushing toward <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_1.html">green mathematics</a>: a kind of mathematics that can interact with biology and ecology just as fruitfully as traditional mathematics interacts with physics.  As usual with math, the payoffs will come slowly, but they may be large.  It&#8217;s not a substitute for doing other, more urgent things&#8212;but if mathematicians don&#8217;t do this, who will?</p>

<p>As a first step in this direction, I decided to study <i>networks</i>.</p>

<p>This May, a small group of mathematicians is meeting in Turin for a workshop on the <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/04/categorical-foundations-of-network-theory/">categorical foundations of network theory</a>, organized by <a href="http://www.thequantumnetwork.org/team/jacob-biamonte/">Jacob Biamonte</a>.   I&#8217;m trying to get us mentally prepared for this.  We all have different ideas, yet they should fit together somehow.   </p>

<p><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/07/resource-convertibility-part-1/">Tobias Fritz</a>, <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/03/18/networks-of-dynamical-systems/">Eugene Lerman</a> and <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/03/27/spivak-part-1/">David Spivak</a> have all written articles here about their work, though I suspect Eugene will have a lot of completely new things to say, too.   Now I want to say a bit about what I&#8217;ve been doing with <a href = "http://mathdept.ucr.edu/gradwebpages/erbele.html">Jason Erbele</a>.</p>
<div><a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/mathml.html"><img class="mathlogo" src="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/images/MathML.png" alt="MathML-enabled post (click for more details)." title="MathML-enabled post (click for details)." /></a></div>
<p>Despite my ultimate aim of studying biological and ecological networks, I decided to start by clarifying the math of networks that appear in chemistry and engineering, since these are simpler, better understood, useful in their own right, and probably a good warmup for the grander goal.  I&#8217;ve been working with Brendan Fong on electrical ciruits, and with Jason Erbele on control theory.  Let me talk about this paper:</p>

<p>&#x02022; John Baez and Jason Erbele, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6881">Categories in control</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory">Control theory</a> is the branch of engineering that focuses on manipulating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_system_%28systems_theory%29">open systems</a>&#x02014;systems with inputs and outputs&#x02014;to achieve desired goals.  In control theory, <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Control_Systems/Signal_Flow_Diagrams#Resistor_R_.28Branch_equation_.29">signal-flow diagrams</a> are used to describe linear ways of manipulating signals, for example smooth real-valued functions of time.   Here&#8217;s a real-world example; click the picture for more details:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-flow_graph#Mechatronics_:_Position_servo_with_multi-loop_feedback">
<img alt = "" width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/position_servo_signal_flow_graph.png" />
</a></p>

<p>For a category theorist, at least, it is natural to treat signal-flow diagrams as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USYRDDZ9yEc&amp;feature=related">string diagrams</a> in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_monoidal_category">symmetric monoidal category</a>.  This forces some small changes of perspective, which I&#8217;ll explain, but more important is the question: <i>which symmetric monoidal category?</i></p>

<p>We argue that the answer is: the category <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">FinRel</mi> <mi>k</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\mathrm{FinRel}_k</annotation></semantics></math> of finite-dimensional vector spaces over a certain field <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k,</annotation></semantics></math> but with <i>linear relations</i> rather than linear maps as morphisms, and <i>direct sum</i> rather than tensor product providing the symmetric monoidal structure.  We use the field <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>&#x0211D;</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>s</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k = \mathbb{R}(s)</annotation></semantics></math> consisting of rational functions in one real variable <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>s.</annotation></semantics></math>  This variable has the meaning of differentation.  A linear relation from <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>k</mi> <mi>m</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k^m</annotation></semantics></math> to <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>k</mi> <mi>n</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k^n</annotation></semantics></math> is thus a system of linear constant-coefficient ordinary differential equations relating <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>m</annotation></semantics></math> &#8216;input&#8217; signals and <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>n</annotation></semantics></math> &#8216;output&#8217; signals.</p>

<p>Our main goal in this paper is to provide a complete &#8216;generators and relations&#8217; picture of this symmetric monoidal category, with the generators being familiar components of signal-flow diagrams.  It turns out that the answer has an intriguing but mysterious connection to ideas that are familiar in the diagrammatic approach to quantum theory!   Quantum theory also involves linear algebra, but it uses linear maps between Hilbert spaces as morphisms, and the tensor product of Hilbert spaces provides the symmetric monoidal structure.</p>

<p>We hope that the category-theoretic viewpoint on signal-flow diagrams will shed new light on control theory.  However, in this paper we only lay the groundwork.</p>

<h3> Signal flow diagrams </h3>

<p>There are several basic operations that one wants to perform when manipulating signals.  The simplest is multiplying a signal by a scalar.  A signal can be amplified by a constant factor:  </p>

<p><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='block'><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>&#x021A6;</mo><mi>cf</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> f \mapsto cf  </annotation></semantics></math></p>

<p>where <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>&#x02208;</mo><mi>&#x0211D;</mi><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>c \in \mathbb{R}.</annotation></semantics></math>  We can write this as a string diagram:</p>

<p><img alt = "" width="100" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_scalar_multiplication.jpg" /></p>

<p>Here the labels <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>f</annotation></semantics></math> and <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>c f</annotation></semantics></math> on top and bottom are just for explanatory purposes and not really part of the diagram.  Control theorists often draw arrows on the wires, but this is unnecessary from the string diagram perspective.  Arrows on wires are useful to distinguish objects from their
duals, but ultimately we will obtain a compact closed category where each object is its own dual, so the arrows can be dropped.  What we really need is for the box denoting scalar multiplication to have a clearly defined input and output.  This is why we draw it as a triangle.  Control theorists often use a rectangle or circle, using arrows on wires to indicate which carries the input <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>f</annotation></semantics></math> and which the output <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi><mi>f</mi><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>c f.</annotation></semantics></math></p>

<p>A signal can also be integrated with respect to the time variable:</p>

<p><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='block'><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>&#x021A6;</mo><mo>&#x0222B;</mo><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> f \mapsto \int f </annotation></semantics></math></p>

<p>Mathematicians typically take differentiation as fundamental, but engineers sometimes prefer integration, because it is more robust against small perturbations.  In the end it  will not matter much here.  We can again draw integration as a string diagram:</p>

<p><img alt = "" width="100" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_integration.jpg" /></p>

<p>Since this looks like the diagram for scalar multiplication, it is natural to extend <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x0211D;</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\mathbb{R}</annotation></semantics></math> to <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x0211D;</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>s</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\mathbb{R}(s),</annotation></semantics></math> the field of rational functions of a variable <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>s</annotation></semantics></math> which stands for differentiation.   Then differentiation becomes a special case of scalar multiplication, namely  multiplication by <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>s,</annotation></semantics></math> and integration becomes multiplication by <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">/</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>1/s.</annotation></semantics></math>  Engineers accomplish the same effect with Laplace transforms, since differentiating a signal <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>f</annotation></semantics></math> is equivalent to multiplying its Laplace transform</p>

<p><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='block'><semantics><mrow><mstyle displaystyle="true"><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>&#x02112;</mi><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>s</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><msubsup><mo>&#x0222B;</mo> <mn>0</mn> <mn>&#x0221E;</mn></msubsup><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><msup><mi>e</mi> <mrow><mo lspace="verythinmathspace" rspace="0em">&#x02212;</mo><mi>st</mi></mrow></msup><mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mi>dt</mi></mrow></mstyle></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\displaystyle{  (\mathcal{L}f)(s) = \int_0^\infty f(t) e^{&#x2d;st} \,dt  }</annotation></semantics></math></p>

<p>by the variable <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>s.</annotation></semantics></math>   Another option is to use the Fourier transform: differentiating <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>f</annotation></semantics></math> is equivalent to multiplying its Fourier transform</p>

<p><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='block'><semantics><mrow><mstyle displaystyle="true"><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>&#x02131;</mi><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>&#x003C9;</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><msubsup><mo>&#x0222B;</mo> <mrow><mo lspace="verythinmathspace" rspace="0em">&#x02212;</mo><mn>&#x0221E;</mn></mrow> <mn>&#x0221E;</mn></msubsup><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><msup><mi>e</mi> <mrow><mo lspace="verythinmathspace" rspace="0em">&#x02212;</mo><mi>i</mi><mi>&#x003C9;</mi><mi>t</mi></mrow></msup><mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mi>dt</mi></mrow></mstyle></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\displaystyle{   (\mathcal{F}f)(\omega) = \int_{&#x2d;\infty}^\infty f(t) e^{&#x2d;i\omega t}\, dt  } </annotation></semantics></math></p>

<p>by <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mo lspace="verythinmathspace" rspace="0em">&#x02212;</mo><mi>i</mi><mi>&#x003C9;</mi><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>&#x2d;i\omega.</annotation></semantics></math>   Of course, the function <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>f</annotation></semantics></math> needs to be sufficiently well-behaved to justify calculations involving its Laplace or Fourier transform.  At a more basic level, it also requires some work to treat integration as the two-sided inverse of differentiation.  Engineers do this by considering signals that vanish for <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>t</mi><mi>&lt;</mi><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>t &amp;lt; 0,</annotation></semantics></math> and choosing the antiderivative that vanishes under the same condition.  Luckily all these issues can be side-stepped in a formal treatment of signal-flow diagrams: we can simply treat signals as living in an unspecified vector space over the field <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x0211D;</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>s</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\mathbb{R}(s).</annotation></semantics></math>  The field <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x02102;</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>s</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\mathbb{C}(s)</annotation></semantics></math> would work just as well, and control theory relies heavily on complex analysis.   In our paper we work over an arbitrary field <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k.</annotation></semantics></math></p>

<p>The simplest possible signal processor is a rock, which takes the &#039;input&#039; given by the force <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>F</annotation></semantics></math> on the rock and produces as &#039;output&#039; the rock&#039;s position <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>q.</annotation></semantics></math>  Thanks to Newton&#039;s second law <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>ma</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>F=ma,</annotation></semantics></math> we can describe this using a signal-flow diagram:</p>

<p>Here composition of morphisms is drawn in the usual way, by attaching the output wire of one morphism to the input wire of the next.</p>

<p>To build more interesting machines we need more building blocks, such as addition:</p>

<p><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='block'><semantics><mrow><mo lspace="verythinmathspace" rspace="0em">+</mo><mo>:</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>&#x021A6;</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> + : (f,g) \mapsto f + g   </annotation></semantics></math></p>

<p>and duplication:</p>

<p><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='block'><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x00394;</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>&#x021A6;</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> \Delta :  f \mapsto (f,f)  </annotation></semantics></math></p>

<p>When these linear maps are written as matrices, their matrices are transposes of each other.  This is reflected in the string diagrams for addition and duplication:</p>

<p><img alt = "" width="350" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_addition_duplication.jpg" /></p>

<p>The second is essentially an upside-down version of the first.  However, we draw addition as a dark triangle and duplication as a light one because we will later want another way to &#8216;turn addition upside-down&#8217; that does <i>not</i> give duplication.  As an added bonus, a light upside-down triangle resembles the Greek letter <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x00394;</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\Delta,</annotation></semantics></math> the usual symbol for duplication.  </p>

<p>While they are typically not considered worthy of mention in control theory, for completeness we must include two other building blocks.  One is the zero map from the zero-dimensional vector space <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">{</mo><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy="false">}</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\{0\}</annotation></semantics></math> to our field <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k,</annotation></semantics></math> which we denote as <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>0</annotation></semantics></math> and draw as follows:</p>

<p><img alt = "" width="50" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_zero.jpg" /></p>

<p> 
The other is the zero map from <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k</annotation></semantics></math> to <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">{</mo><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy="false">}</mo><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\{0\},</annotation></semantics></math> sometimes called &#8216;deletion&#8217;, which we denote as <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mo>!</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>!</annotation></semantics></math> and draw thus:
 </p>

<p><img alt = "" width="50" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_deletion.jpg" /></p>

<p>Just as the matrices for addition and duplication are transposes of each other, so are the matrices for zero and deletion, though they are rather degenerate, being <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>&#x000D7;</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>1 \times 0</annotation></semantics></math> and <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn><mo>&#x000D7;</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>0 \times 1</annotation></semantics></math> matrices, respectively.  Addition and zero make <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k</annotation></semantics></math> into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid_%28category_theory%29"><b>commutative monoid</b></a>, meaning that the following relations hold:</p>

<p><img alt = "" width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_commutative_monoid.jpg" /></p>

<p>The equation at right is the commutative law, and the crossing of strands is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braided_monoidal_category">braiding</a>:</p>

<p><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='block'><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi><mo>:</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>&#x021A6;</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>       B : (f,g) \mapsto (g,f)  </annotation></semantics></math></p>

<p>by which we switch two signals.   In fact this braiding is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_monoidal_category">symmetry</a>, so it does not matter which strand goes over which:</p>

<p><img alt = "" width="250" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_symmetry.jpg" /></p>

<p>Dually, duplication and deletion make <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k</annotation></semantics></math> into a cocommutative <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/comonoid"><b>comonoid</b></a>.  This means that if we reflect the equations obeyed by addition and zero across the horizontal axis and turn dark operations into light ones, we obtain another set of valid equations:</p>

<p><img alt = "" width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_cocommutative_comonoid.jpg" /></p>

<p>There are also relations between the monoid and comonoid operations.  For example, adding two signals and then duplicating the result gives the same output as duplicating each signal and then adding the results:</p>

<p><img alt = "" width="400" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_bimonoid_multiplication_comultiplication.jpg" /></p>

<p>This diagram is familiar in the theory of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_algebra">Hopf algebras</a>, or more generally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bialgebra">bialgebras</a>.  Here it is an example of the fact that the monoid operations on <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k</annotation></semantics></math> are comonoid homomorphisms&#x02014;or equivalently, the comonoid operations are monoid homomorphisms.   </p>

<p>We summarize this situation by saying that <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k</annotation></semantics></math> is a <b>bimonoid</b>.  These are all the bimonoid laws, drawn as diagrams:</p>

<p><img alt = "" width="200" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_bimonoid_1.jpg" />
<img alt = "" width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_bimonoid_2.jpg" /></p>

<p>The last equation means we can actually make the diagram at left disappear, since it equals the identity morphism on the 0-dimensional vector space, which is drawn as <i>nothing</i>.</p>

<p>So far all our string diagrams denote linear maps.  We can treat these as morphisms in the category <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">FinVect</mi> <mi>k</mi></msub><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\mathrm{FinVect}_k,</annotation></semantics></math> where objects are finite-dimensional vector spaces over a field <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k</annotation></semantics></math> and morphisms are linear maps.  This category is equivalent to the category where the only objects are vector spaces <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>k</mi> <mi>n</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k^n</annotation></semantics></math> for <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>&#x02265;</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>n \ge 0,</annotation></semantics></math> and then morphisms can be seen as <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>&#x000D7;</mo><mi>m</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>n \times m</annotation></semantics></math> matrices.  The space of signals is a vector space <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>V</annotation></semantics></math> over <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k</annotation></semantics></math> which may not be finite-dimensional, but this does not cause a problem: an <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>&#x000D7;</mo><mi>m</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>n \times m</annotation></semantics></math> matrix with entries in <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k</annotation></semantics></math> still defines a linear map from <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>V</mi> <mi>n</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>V^n</annotation></semantics></math> to <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>V</mi> <mi>m</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>V^m</annotation></semantics></math> in a functorial way.</p>

<p>In applications of string diagrams to quantum theory, we make <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">FinVect</mi> <mi>k</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\mathrm{FinVect}_k</annotation></semantics></math> into a symmetric monoidal category using the tensor product of vector spaces.  In control theory, we instead make <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">FinVect</mi> <mi>k</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\mathrm{FinVect}_k</annotation></semantics></math> into a symmetric monoidal category using the <i>direct sum</i> of vector spaces.  In Lemma 1 of our paper we prove that for any field <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k,</annotation></semantics></math> <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">FinVect</mi> <mi>k</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\mathrm{FinVect}_k</annotation></semantics></math> with direct sum is generated as a symmetric monoidal category by the one object <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k</annotation></semantics></math> together with these morphisms:</p>

<p><img alt = "" width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generators_FinVect.jpg" /></p>

<p>where <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>&#x02208;</mo><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>c \in k</annotation></semantics></math> is arbitrary.  </p>

<p>However, these generating morphisms obey some unexpected relations!  For example, we have:</p>

<p><img alt = "" width="400" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_braiding.jpg" /></p>

<p>Thus, it is important to find a complete set of relations obeyed by these generating morphisms, thus obtaining a presentation of <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">FinVect</mi> <mi>k</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\mathrm{FinVect}_k</annotation></semantics></math> as a symmetric monoidal category.  We do this in Theorem 2.  In brief, these relations say:</p>

<p>(1) <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mo lspace="verythinmathspace" rspace="0em">+</mo><mo>,</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo><mi>&#x00394;</mi><mo>,</mo><mo>!</mo><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'> (k, +, 0, \Delta, !)</annotation></semantics></math> is a bicommutative bimonoid;</p>

<p>(2) the rig operations of <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k</annotation></semantics></math> can be recovered from the generating morphisms;</p>

<p>(3) all the generating morphisms commute with scalar multiplication.</p>

<p>Here item (2) means that <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mo lspace="verythinmathspace" rspace="0em">+</mo><mo>,</mo><mo>&#x022C5;</mo><mo>,</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>+, \cdot, 0</annotation></semantics></math> and <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>1</annotation></semantics></math> in the field <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k</annotation></semantics></math> can be expressed in terms of signal-flow diagrams as follows:</p>

<p><img alt = "" width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_rig_1.jpg" /></p>

<p><img alt = "" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_rig_2.jpg" /></p>

<p>Multiplicative inverses cannot be so expressed, so our signal-flow diagrams so far do not know that <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k</annotation></semantics></math> is a field.  Additive inverses also cannot be expressed in this way.  So, we expect that a version of Theorem 2 will hold whenever <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k</annotation></semantics></math> is a mere <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring">rig</a>: that is, a &#8216;ring without negatives&#8217;, like the natural numbers.  The one change is that instead of working with vector spaces, we should work with finitely presented free <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k</annotation></semantics></math>-modules.</p>

<p>Item (3), the fact that all our generating morphisms commute with scalar multiplication, amounts to these diagrammatic equations:</p>

<p><img alt = "" width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_linearity_1.jpg" /></p>

<p><img alt = "" width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_linearity_2.jpg" /></p>

<p>While Theorem 2 is a step towards understanding the category-theoretic underpinnings of control theory, it does not treat signal-flow diagrams that include &#8216;feedback&#8217;.  Feedback is one of the most fundamental concepts in control theory because a control system without feedback may be highly sensitive to disturbances or unmodeled behavior.  Feedback allows these uncontrolled behaviors to be mollified.  As a string diagram, a basic feedback system might look schematically like this:
  </p>

<p><img alt = "" width="300" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/signal_flow_diagram_feedback_loop.jpg" /></p>

<p>The user inputs a &#8216;reference&#8217; signal, which is fed into a controller, whose output is fed into a system, which control theorists call a &#8216;plant&#8217;, which in turn produces its own output.  But then the system&#8217;s output is duplicated, and one copy is fed into a sensor, whose output is added (or if we prefer, subtracted) from the reference signal.</p>

<p>In string diagrams&#x02014;unlike in the usual thinking on control theory&#x02014;it is essential to be  able to read any diagram from top to bottom as a composite of tensor products of generating morphisms.   Thus, to incorporate the idea of feedback, we need two more generating morphisms.  These are the &#8216;cup&#8217;:</p>

<p><img alt = "" width="150" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_cup.jpg" /></p>

<p>and &#8216;cap&#8217;:</p>

<p><img alt = "" width="150" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_cap.jpg" /></p>

<p>These are not maps: they are relations.  The cup imposes the relation that its two inputs be equal, while the cap does the same for its two outputs.  This is a way of describing how a signal flows around a bend in a wire.</p>

<p>To make this precise, we use a category called <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">FinRel</mi> <mi>k</mi></msub><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\mathrm{FinRel}_k.</annotation></semantics></math>  An object of this category is a finite-dimensional vector space over <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k,</annotation></semantics></math> while a morphism from <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>U</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>U</annotation></semantics></math> to <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>V,</annotation></semantics></math> denoted <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>U</mi><mo>&#x021C0;</mo><mi>V</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>L : U \rightharpoonup V,</annotation></semantics></math> is a <b>linear relation</b>, meaning a linear subspace</p>

<p>Since the direct sum <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>U</mi><mo>&#x02295;</mo><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>U \oplus V</annotation></semantics></math> is also the cartesian product of <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>U</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>U</annotation></semantics></math> and <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>V,</annotation></semantics></math> a linear relation is indeed a relation in the usual sense, but with the property that if <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>u</mi><mo>&#x02208;</mo><mi>U</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>u \in U</annotation></semantics></math> is  related to <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>&#x02208;</mo><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>v \in V</annotation></semantics></math> and <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>u</mi><mo>&#x02032;</mo><mo>&#x02208;</mo><mi>U</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>u&apos; \in U</annotation></semantics></math> is related to <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>&#x02032;</mo><mo>&#x02208;</mo><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>v&apos; \in V</annotation></semantics></math> then <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi><mi>u</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>&#x02032;</mo><mi>u</mi><mo>&#x02032;</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>c u + c&apos;u&apos;</annotation></semantics></math> is related to <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi><mi>v</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>&#x02032;</mo><mi>v</mi><mo>&#x02032;</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>c v + c&apos;v&apos;</annotation></semantics></math> whenever <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>&#x02032;</mo><mo>&#x02208;</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>c,c&apos; \in k.</annotation></semantics></math>  </p>

<p>These obey the <b>zigzag relations</b>:</p>

<p><img alt = "" width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_zigzag.jpg" /></p>

<p>Thus, they make <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">FinRel</mi> <mi>k</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\mathrm{FinRel}_k</annotation></semantics></math> into a compact closed category where <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k,</annotation></semantics></math> and thus every object, is its own dual.  </p>

<p>Besides feedback, one of the things that make the cap and cup useful is that they allow any morphism <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>U</mi><mo>&#x021C0;</mo><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>L : U \rightharpoonup V </annotation></semantics></math> to be &#8216;plugged in backwards&#8217; and thus &#8216;turned around&#8217;.  For instance, turning around integration:
 </p>

<p><img alt = "" width="150" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/signal_flow_diagram_flipped_integration.jpg" /></p>

<p>we obtain differentiation.  In general, using caps and cups we can turn around any linear relation <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>U</mi><mo>&#x021C0;</mo><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>L : U \rightharpoonup V</annotation></semantics></math> and obtain a linear relation <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>L</mi> <mo>&#x02020;</mo></msup><mo>:</mo><mi>V</mi><mo>&#x021C0;</mo><mi>U</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>L^\dagger : V \rightharpoonup U,</annotation></semantics></math> called the <b>adjoint</b> of <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>L,</annotation></semantics></math> which turns out to given by</p>

<p>For example, if <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>&#x02208;</mo><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>c \in k</annotation></semantics></math> is nonzero, the adjoint of scalar multiplication by <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>c</annotation></semantics></math> is multiplication by <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>c</mi> <mrow><mo lspace="verythinmathspace" rspace="0em">&#x02212;</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>c^{&#x2d;1}</annotation></semantics></math>:</p>

<p><img alt = "" width="250" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_inverse.jpg" /></p>

<p>Thus, caps and cups allow us to express multiplicative inverses in terms of signal-flow diagrams! One might think that a problem arises when when <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>c = 0,</annotation></semantics></math> but no: the adjoint of scalar multiplication by <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>0</annotation></semantics></math> is</p>

<p>In Lemma 3 we show that <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">FinRel</mi> <mi>k</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\mathrm{FinRel}_k</annotation></semantics></math> is generated, as a symmetric monoidal category, by these morphisms:</p>

<p><img alt = "" width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generators_FinRel.jpg" /></p>

<p>where <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>&#x02208;</mo><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>c \in k</annotation></semantics></math> is arbitrary.  </p>

<p>In Theorem 4 we find a complete set of relations obeyed by these generating morphisms,thus giving a presentation of <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">FinRel</mi> <mi>k</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\mathrm{FinRel}_k</annotation></semantics></math> as a symmetric monoidal category.  To describe these relations, it is useful to work with adjoints of the generating morphisms.  We have already seen that the adjoint of scalar multiplication by <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>c</annotation></semantics></math> is scalar multiplication by <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>c</mi> <mrow><mo lspace="verythinmathspace" rspace="0em">&#x02212;</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>c^{&#x2d;1},</annotation></semantics></math> except when <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>c = 0.</annotation></semantics></math>  Taking adjoints of the other four generating morphisms of <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">FinVect</mi> <mi>k</mi></msub><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\mathrm{FinVect}_k,</annotation></semantics></math> we obtain four important but perhaps unfamiliar linear relations.

<p>Conversely, any commutative special &#x02020;-Frobenius monoid in <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">FinHilb</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\mathrm{FinHilb}</annotation></semantics></math> arises this way.  </p>

<p>Considerably earlier, around 1995, commutative Frobenius monoids were recognized as important in topological quantum field theory.  The reason, ultimately, is that the free symmetric monoidal category on a commutative Frobenius monoid is <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">Cob</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>2\mathrm{Cob},</annotation></semantics></math> the category with 2-dimensional oriented cobordisms as morphisms.  But the free symmetric monoidal category on a commutative <i>special</i> Frobenius monoid was worked out even earlier: it is the category with finite sets as objects, where a morphism <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>&#x02192;</mo><mi>Y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>f : X \to Y</annotation></semantics></math> is an isomorphism class of cospans</p>

<p><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='block'><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi><mo>&#x027F6;</mo><mi>S</mi><mo>&#x027F5;</mo><mi>Y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>        X \longrightarrow S \longleftarrow Y  </annotation></semantics></math></p>

<p>This category can be made into a &#x02020;-compact category in an obvious way, and then the 1-element set becomes a commutative special &#x02020;-Frobenius monoid.  </p>

<p>For all these reasons, it is interesting to find a commutative special &#x02020;-Frobenius monoid lurking at the heart of control theory!  However, the Frobenius monoid here has yet another property, which is more unusual.  Namely, the unit <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn><mo>:</mo><mo stretchy="false">{</mo><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy="false">}</mo><mo>&#x021C0;</mo><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>0 : \{0\} \rightharpoonup k</annotation></semantics></math> followed by the counit <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msup><mn>0</mn> <mo>&#x02020;</mo></msup><mo>:</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>&#x021C0;</mo><mo stretchy="false">{</mo><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy="false">}</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>0^\dagger : k \rightharpoonup \{0\} </annotation></semantics></math> is the identity:</p>

<p><img alt = "" width="100" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_extra_addition.jpg" /></p>

<p>We call a special Frobenius monoid that also obeys this extra law <b>extra-special</b>.  One can check that the free symmetric monoidal category on a commutative extra-special Frobenius monoid is the category with finite sets as objects, where a morphism <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>&#x02192;</mo><mi>Y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>f : X \to Y</annotation></semantics></math> is an equivalence relation on the disjoint union <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi><mo>&#x02294;</mo><mi>Y</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>X \sqcup Y,</annotation></semantics></math> and we compose <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>&#x02192;</mo><mi>Y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>f : X \to Y</annotation></semantics></math> and <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>Y</mi><mo>&#x02192;</mo><mi>Z</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>g : Y \to Z</annotation></semantics></math> by letting <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>f</annotation></semantics></math> and <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>g</annotation></semantics></math> generate an equivalence relation on <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi><mo>&#x02294;</mo><mi>Y</mi><mo>&#x02294;</mo><mi>Z</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>X \sqcup Y \sqcup Z</annotation></semantics></math> and then restricting this to <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi><mo>&#x02294;</mo><mi>Z</mi><mo>.</mo></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>X \sqcup Z.</annotation></semantics></math></p>

<p>As if this were not enough, the light operations share many properties with the dark ones.

<p>It should be no surprise that with all these structures built in, signal-flow diagrams are a powerful method of designing processes.  </p>

<p>However, it is surprising that most of these structures are present in a seemingly very different context: the so-called <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.4725">ZX calculus</a>, a diagrammatic formalism for working with complementary observables in quantum theory.

So, we have all the structure present in the list above&#x02014;except that these Frobenius monoids are only extra-special if <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>H</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>H</annotation></semantics></math> is 1-dimensional.  </p>

Jason and I focus on <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>k</annotation></semantics></math> in our paper simply because it generates all the objects <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">FinRel</mi> <mi>k</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\mathrm{FinRel}_k</annotation></semantics></math> via direct sum.</p>

<p>Finally, in <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">FinRel</mi> <mi>k</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\mathrm{FinRel}_k</annotation></semantics></math> the cap and cup are related to the light and dark operations as follows:</p>

<p>So, we have a good categorical understanding of the linear algebra used in signal flow diagrams!  </p>

<p>Now Jason is moving ahead to apply this to some interesting problems&#8230; but that&#8217;s another story, for later.</p>

<p>At last, I have a complete draft of my chapter for Elaine Landry&#8217;s book <em>Categories for the working philosopher</em>.  It&#8217;s currently titled</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Homotopy Type Theory: A synthetic approach to higher equalities</strong>. <a href="http://www.sandiego.edu/~shulman/papers/synhott.pdf">pdf</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see (if you read it), not much is left of the one fragment of <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2015/02/introduction_to_synthetic_math.html">draft</a> that I posted earlier; I decided to spend the available space on HoTT itself rather than detour into synthetic mathematics more generally.  Although the conversations arising from that draft were still helpful, and my <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2015/03/hits_and_the_erlangen_program.html">other</a> recent ramblings did make it in.</p>

<p>Comments, questions, and suggestions would be very much appreciated!  It&#8217;s due this Sunday (I got an extension from the original deadline), so there&#8217;s a very short window of time to make changes before I have to submit it.  I expect I&#8217;ll be able to revise it again later in the process, though.</p>

<p>I attended a workshop last week down in Bristol organised by James Ladyman and Stuart Presnell, as part of their <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/arts/research/projects/homotopy-type-theory/">Homotopy Type Theory project</a>.</p>

<p>Urs was there, showing everyone his magical conjuring trick where the world emerges out of the opposition between <strong><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x02205;</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\emptyset</annotation></semantics></math></strong> and <strong><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mo>&#x0002A;</mo><mspace width="thickmathspace"/></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>\ast\;</annotation></semantics></math></strong>  in <a href="http://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/Modern+Physics+formalized+in+Modal+Homotopy+Type+Theory">Modern Physics formalized in Modal Homotopy Type Theory</a>.</p>

<p>Jamie Vicary spoke on the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2054">Categorified Heisenberg Algebra</a>. (See also John&#8217;s <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/spans/">page</a>.) After the talk, interesting connections were discussed with <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/dependent+linear+type+theory">dependent linear type theory</a> and <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/tangent+%28infinity%2C1%29-category">tangent (infinity, 1)-toposes</a>. It seems that Andr&#x000E9; Joyal and colleagues are working on the latter. This should link up with Urs&#8217;s <a href="http://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/Quantization+via+Linear+homotopy+types">Quantization via Linear homotopy types</a> at some stage.</p>

<p>As for me, I was speaking on the subject of my chapter for the book that Mike&#8217;s <em>Introduction to Synthetic Mathematics</em> and John&#8217;s <em>Concepts of Sameness</em> will appear in. It&#8217;s on reviving the philosophy of geometry through the (synthetic) approach of <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cohesive+homotopy+type+theory">cohesion</a>. </p>

<p>In the talk I mentioned the outcome of some further thinking about how to treat the phrase &#8216;the structure of <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding='application/x-tex'>A</annotation></semantics></math>&#8217; for a mathematical entity. It occurred to me to combine what I wrote in that discussion we once had on <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2013/11/the_covariance_of_coloured_bal.html#c045307">The covariance of coloured balls</a> with the analysis of &#8216;the&#8217; from <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2013/01/the_king_of_france.html#c043426">The King of France</a> thread. After the event I thought I&#8217;d write out a note explaining this point of view, and it can be found <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16936016/The_Structure.pdf">here</a>. Thanks to Mike and Urs for suggestions and comments. </p>

<p>The long and the short of it is that there&#8217;s no great need for the word &#8216;structure&#8217; when using homotopy type theory. If anyone has any thoughts, I&#8217;d like to hear them. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m helping run a workshop on <a href="http://www.nimbios.org/workshops/WS_entropy">Information and Entropy in Biological Systems</a> at NIMBioS, the National Institute of Mathematical and Biological Synthesis, which is in Knoxville Tennessee.</p>

<p>I think you&#8217;ll be able to watch live streaming video of this workshop while it&#8217;s taking place from Wednesday April 8th to Friday April 10th.  Later, videos will be made available in a permanent location.</p>

<p>To watch the workshop live, go <b><a href="http://www.nimbios.org/videos/livestream">here</a></b>. Go down to where it says </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Investigative Workshop: Information and Entropy in Biological Systems </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then click where it says <b>live link</b>.  There&#8217;s nothing there <em>now</em>, but I&#8217;m hoping there will be when the show starts!</p>

<p>Below you can see the schedule of talks and a list of participants.  The hours are in Eastern Daylight Time: add 4 hours to get Greenwich Mean Time.  The talks start at 10 am EDT, which is 2 pm GMT.</p>

<h3>Schedule</h3>

<p>There will be 1&#x000BD; hours of talks in the morning and 1&#x000BD; hours in the afternoon for each of the 3 days, Wednesday April 8th to Friday April 10th.  The rest of the time will be for discussions on different topics.  We&#8217;ll break up into groups, based on what people want to discuss.</p>

<p>Each invited speaker will give a 30-minute talk summarizing the key ideas in some area, <i>not</i> their latest research so much as what everyone should know to start interesting conversations.  After that, 15 minutes for questions and/or coffee.   </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the schedule.  You can already see slides or other material for the talks with links!</p>

<p>&#x02022;  Katharina Brinck - grad student at Centre for Complexity Science at Imperial College; did masters at John Harte&#8217;s lab, where she extended his Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology (METE) to trophic food webs, to study how  entropy maximization on the macro scale together with MEP on the scale of individuals drive the structural development of model ecosystems.</p>

<p>&#x02022; Christina Cobbold - mathematical biologist, has studied the role of species similarity in measuring biodiversity.</p>

<p>&#x02022;  Troy Day - mathematical biologist, works with population dynamics, host-parasite dynamics, etc.; influential and could help move population dynamics to a more information-theoretic foundation.</p>

<p>&#x02022; Roderick Dewar - physicist who studies the principle of maximal entropy production.</p>

<p>&#x02022; Barrett Deris - <abbr title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</abbr> postdoc studying the studying the factors that influence evolvability of drug resistance in bacteria.  </p>

<p>&#x02022; Charlotte de Vries - a biology master&#8217;s student who studied particle physics to the master&#8217;s level at Oxford and the Perimeter Institute.   Interested in information theory.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m leaving tomorrow for an &#8220;investigative workshop&#8221; on <a href="http://www.nimbios.org/workshops/WS_entropy">Information and
Entropy in Biological
Systems</a>, co-organized by our
own John Baez, in Knoxville, Tennessee.  I&#8217;m excited!  And I&#8217;m hoping to
learn a lot.</p>

<p>A quick linkdump before I go:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reflexive completion</strong> &#x000A0; <a href="http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~s1335220/">Tom Avery</a> and I are writing a
paper on Isbell conjugacy and reflexive completion (also called Isbell or
MacNeille completion).  I gave a <a href="http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/cambridge_bmc/">talk on
it</a> last week at the British
Mathematical Colloquium in Cambridge, which is somewhat similar to the
Joint Meetings in the US.</p>

<p>The concepts of Isbell conjugacy and reflexive completion are at the same <i>very</i> basic, primitive categorical level as the
Yoneda lemma.  They rely on nothing more than the notions of
category, functor and natural transformation.  But they&#8217;re immeasurably
less well-known than the Yoneda lemma.</p>

<p>As for Tom, you may remember him from the <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2014/02/metric_spaces_generalized_logi.html">Kan Extension
Seminar</a>.
He&#8217;s doing a PhD with me here in Edinburgh.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mathematicians accepting and resisting overtures from GCHQ</strong> &#x000A0; The British Mathematical Colloquium was part-sponsored by the UK surveillance
agency GCHQ, which I&#8217;ve <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2014/07/math_and_mass_surveillance_a_r.html">written about many times
before</a>.
They paid for one of the plenary talks and some of the costs of student
attendance.  (They didn&#8217;t pay for me.)</p>

<p>I began my talk by expressing both my thanks to the organizers and my
disappointment in them for allowing an extremist organization like GCHQ to
buy itself a presence at the conference.  As I understand it, the deal was
that in return for the money it paid, GCHQ got a recruiting platform for
the Heilbronn Institute (their academic brand).  For instance, the
conference hosted a Heilbronn recruitment session, advertised in the blurb
that every delegate received.  </p>

<p>And I said that although one might think it
irregular for me to be taking a few moments of my seminar to talk about
this, consider the fact that GCHQ bought itself three whole days in which
to create the impression that working for an agency of mass surveillance is
a normal, decent thing for a mathematician to do.</p>

<p>There were several encouraging signs, though: </p>

<ul>
<li>An important person within the organizational structure of the British
Mathematical Colloquium (an annual event) exhibited clear awareness that
GCHQ involvement in the BMC was controversial. This is a start, though it requires people to keep pointing out that committees, as well as individuals, are making a political choice when they cooperate with the intelligence agencies.  </li>
<li>The conference website
advertised that GCHQ would have a stand/booth at the conference, but in the end they
didn&#8217;t &#x02014; perhaps knowing that they&#8217;d have been asking for trouble.  </li>
<li>I heard that a certain prominent
British mathematician had refused requests to review from both GCHQ and the NSA.</li>
<li>And as
usual, just about every mathematician I spoke to was opposed to GCHQ mass surveillance. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The Euler characteristic of an algebra</strong> &#x000A0; I recently gave a couple of talks entitled &#8220;The Euler characteristic of
an algebra&#8221;: <a href="http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/louvain_pssl/">one for category
theorists</a> and <a href="http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/glasgow_2015/">one for
algebraists</a>.  This represents
joint work with <a href="http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/j.chuang/">Joe Chuang</a> and
<a href="http://people.bath.ac.uk/masadk/">Alastair King</a>, which I hope we&#8217;ll have
written up soon.  I wrote a
<a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2014/05/categories_vs_algebras.html">couple</a>
of
<a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2014/10/the_atoms_of_the_module_world.html">posts</a>
warming up to this result, though I never got round to the result itself.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review of Nick Gurski&#8217;s higher categories book</strong> &#x000A0; I wrote a
<a href="http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/gurski_review/gurski_review.pdf">review</a> of
<a href="http://gurski.staff.shef.ac.uk/">Nick Gurski</a>&#8217;s book <a href="http://ebooks.cambridge.org/ebook.jsf?bid=CBO9781139542333"><em>Coherence in
Three-Dimensional Category
Theory</em></a>.  The
review will appear in the <em>Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Are lectures the best way to teach?</strong> &#x000A0; Nick also has an <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/mar/31/are-lectures-the-best-way-to-teach-students">opinion piece in <em>The
Guardian</em></a>
(joint with his colleague Sam Marsh), answering the question: are lectures the
best way to teach students?</p></li>
