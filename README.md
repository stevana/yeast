[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stevana/yeast.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stevana/yeast)

A Haskell library for working with different kinds of feeds (RSS1, RSS2,
and Atom).

Some more work is still needed before it can be put on Hackage:

  * Haddock with doctests
  * Pass the test suite
  * More unit tests
  * Cabal package constraints so that it builds on older versions of GHC?
  * Integrate stylish-haskell, hlint, etc?
  * Benchmarks?
